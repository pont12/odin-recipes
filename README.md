# odin-recipes
My first project following The Odin Project curriculum. This project is a website that details my favorite recipes. The goal of this project is to bring together everything I've learned about HTML basics so far, particularly:
- Properly setting up the HTML boilerplate
- Working with text and headings
- Creating ordered and unordered lists
- Inserting images
- Using relative links to link to other pages within the project
